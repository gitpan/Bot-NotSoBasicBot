Bot-NotSoBasicBot

The Bot::NoSoBasicBot is a ramification of the fantastic Bot::BasicBot class,
with the addition of

- A 'mode' command to allow moderation bots
- An event queue to manage delayed responses and actions (based on Event::Schedule)
- More organized logging management
- A specific 'response' callback to simplify coding of responses

Listener and Roberts modules are included in the distribution for later use, but
have not yet been populated with working code.  Watch this space for further
details!
